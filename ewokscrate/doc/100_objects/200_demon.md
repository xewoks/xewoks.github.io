# Demon objects{id=demon}

Each demon on the list is represented by a `Demon` object. The following assumptions can be made about these:

- The `requirement` value lies between `0` and `100`.
- There are no holes in the positioning and the `position` value is greater than `0`
- Every `video` value, if provided, is in one of the formats listed [here](/documentation/#video), or `null`

Note that although on the website the record requirement for demons on the extended list is always displayed as `100%`,
`Demon` objects still save their requirement from when they were on the main list.

## Minimal Form

When embedded into other objects (for example, as part of a [Record](/documentation/objects/#record)), only the following minimal representation of each demon is provided:

| Field    | Type    | Description                                                                               |

| position  | integer?           | The position of the demon. Is `null` for unplaced demons|
| id       | integer | The demons internal ID (has nothing to do with its level ID on the geometry dash servers) |

## Listed Form

When retrieving demons via [`GET /demons/`](/documentation/demons/#get-demons), only the following partial representation of each demon is provided:

| Field     | Type              | Description                                                                               |
