# The pointercrate API

This is the documentation for the pointercrate application programming interface (short: API). If you dont know what an API is or have no idea how you even got to this page, [this link](/demonlist/) takes you back to the demonlist. If you rather want to read source code of the implementation directly, head over to the [github repository](https://github.com/stadust/pointercrate/) instead. It also contains the markdown files these documentation pages are generated from, so if you find any error here feel free to submit a pull request!

The API can be used to retrieve data about the demonlist and is internally used to manage it.
All endpoints described here are located under `https://pointercrate.com/api/v1/` unless a different api version is explicitly provided,
in which case the `v1` part of the URL needs to be amended. Currently, there are only a few endpoints using a `v2` scheme.

It is always good practice setting the `Accept` header in requests to `application/json` (or at least give `application/json` a higher preference than `text/html`), so that in case of errors, you receive a JSON response instead of the HTML error page.

All HTTP traffic is automatically redirected to HTTPS. All requests to URLs without a trailing slash are automatically redirected to URLs with one.

## Errors

In case of a client or server error, the API returns an [error response](/documentation/objects/#error). Errors that are specific to a given endpoint are always listed in that endpoint's documentation. Following is an exhaustive list of errors that can occur at _any_ endpoint in the API. Note that the errors with status code `500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR` should (obviously) not occur and are only listed for completeness sake. An complete ist of _all_ errors can be found at the bottom on this page.

In the case that you do not receive any response at all, or receive a Apache/Nginx error page you can assume that the pointercrate server crashed and couldn't recover. If this is the case all hope is lost.

### `409` versus `412`

The cases in which a `409 CONFLICT` error or a `412 PRECONDITION FAILED` error is returned are very similar. In fact, handling for both errors should probably be identical. A `409` error is returned if the request you were making contained a valid hash of the object you were trying to access, however the same was true for another concurrent request. Which ever of the requests commits its database level transaction might now receive the `CONFLICT` error. A `412` error means that a modification to the object you were trying to access happen at some point prior to your current request (or the hash you sent along was invalid in the first place).

Both cases need to be handled the same way: You'll have to re-`GET` the object to retrieve its updated `ETag` and retry the request (simply retrying after a `409` error will most likely yield a `412` error directly after)
